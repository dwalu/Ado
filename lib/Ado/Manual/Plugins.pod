=head1 NAME

Ado::Manual::Plugins - Ado plugins and how to write an Ado::Plugin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There is I<almost> nothing special about writing an L<Ado::Plugin>.
The only difference between Ado and Mojolicious plugins is that Ado 
plugins can retreive their settings from their own files.

The files must be named after the plugins for which they contain configuration.
A plugin Ado::Plugin::Hello will search its configuration
C<app-E<gt>home-E<gt>rel_dir('etc/plugins/hello.conf')>.
The file must return a HASHREF.
See the code of the listed plugins below for examples of 
how and what can be done in a plugin.

L<Ado> can be stripped down to a bare Mojolicious application 
by not loading any plugins.
And L<Ado> can be extended I<infinitely> just by adding helpers and
routes, and injecting code into hooks from plugins.
I<This is true for any Mojolicious application.>
