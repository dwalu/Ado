This folder contains some additional fonts and subset of fonts.
The subsets are made by typing the needed letters into an OpenDocument file,
exporting it to PDF then extracting the embedded subset using
http://onlinefontconverter.com/

Currently we have:
A subset from the Free Serif font containing only the uppercase letters from 
the GLAGOLITIC Alphabet (the first Bulgarian alphabed designed by Saint Cyril)
FreeSerif-Glagolitic-UC.ttf  FreeSerif-Glagolitic-UC.woff
https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/license.html
We use it for our codenames.
